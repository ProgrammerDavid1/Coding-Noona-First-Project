This is a project inspired by the drinking game Up Down.


## Function
- The computer picks a random number at the start of the game.<br>
- Users can enter numbers.<br>
- If the number entered by the user is smaller than the number selected by the computer, it will be notified as "Up".<br>
- If the number entered by the user is larger than the number selected by the computer, it will tell you "Down".<br>
- If the number entered by the user matches the number selected by the computer, it appears as "That's right" and the game ends.<br>
- The user has a total of five opportunities.<br>
- When the game ends, the button is disabled.<br>
- Press the reset button to reset the game.<br>
- When a user enters a number outside the range of 1 to 100, a warning message appears(not lose one's chance).<br>
- A warning message appears when the user enters the value already entered(not lose one's chance).<br>
- The numbers automatically disappear when you place the mouse cursor in the input compartment.<br>
- If you get the correct answer, the button is disabled.<br>
